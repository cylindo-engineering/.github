# .github
Shared repo to host default files like issue templates etc.

Based on this guide: https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file

All repos that do not have community or template files created will default to the ones in this repo.
